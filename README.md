#Project Description

This project is a basic app build on Create React App that implements the AWS Amplify library to enable basic auth through Amazon Cognito Identity Pools and User Pools. It also includes basic routing logic to direct authenticated or unauthenticated users to appropriate pages, and some basic settings functionality.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
